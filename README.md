# rodCutting
A Java program that implements the dynamic programming algorithm for the Rod Cutting problem. This program consists of a single Java class named RodCutting.java, and is compilable with the simple command "javac RodCutting.java". This program takes two command-line arguments: an input file and an output file. The first line of the input file is an integer N, which represents the number of problem instances contained in the file. It is then followed by the N instance specifications. The first line of the specification of each instance is an integer M, that represents the size of the price list in that instance. It is then followed by M lines, each containing an element of the price list, where the i-th line contains the price for length i.  The output file created by this program contains N lines, where the j-th line consists of a single number representing the solution to the j-th instance in the input file.
